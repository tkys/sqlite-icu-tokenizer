# Binary Distribution Strategy for SQLite ICU Extension

This document explains how to automate cross-platform binary builds and distribution for SQLite extensions, eliminating the need to manually build for every platform and version combination.

## The Problem

**Manual builds are unsustainable:**
- Multiple OS platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Different architectures (x86_64, ARM64)
- Various OS versions and dependencies
- Time-consuming and error-prone process
- Users without development environments can't use extensions

## Modern Solution: CI/CD Automation

### GitHub Actions Matrix Builds

**Automated cross-platform builds** that run simultaneously:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    include:
      - os: ubuntu-20.04, platform: linux, arch: x86_64, extension: so
      - os: macos-12, platform: darwin, arch: x86_64, extension: dylib
      - os: macos-14, platform: darwin, arch: arm64, extension: dylib  
      - os: windows-2022, platform: win32, arch: x86_64, extension: dll
```

**Result:** 6 different platform binaries built automatically in parallel, completing in ~5 minutes total.

## Distribution Strategy

### 1. Automated Release Pipeline

**Triggered by Git tags:**
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
# → Automatically builds and releases binaries for all platforms
```

**Generated Release Assets:**
- `fts5icu-linux-x86_64.so` (Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 compatible)
- `fts5icu-darwin-x86_64.dylib` (Intel Macs)
- `fts5icu-darwin-arm64.dylib` (Apple Silicon Macs)
- `fts5icu-win32-x86_64.dll` (Windows 10/11)
- `checksums.txt` (SHA256 verification)

### 2. User Experience

**Before (manual build):**
```bash
# User needs: gcc, make, libicu-dev, sqlite source, build knowledge
sudo apt-get install build-essential libicu-dev
wget https://sqlite.org/2025/sqlite-amalgamation-3500400.zip
unzip sqlite-amalgamation-3500400.zip
make clean && make
# Often fails due to missing dependencies or version mismatches
```

**After (binary distribution):**
```bash
# User downloads appropriate binary
wget https://github.com/tkys/sqlite-icu-tokenizer/releases/latest/download/fts5icu-linux-x86_64.so

# Immediate usage
sqlite3
.load ./fts5icu-linux-x86_64.so sqlite3_icufts5_init
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE docs USING fts5(content, tokenize='icu');
```

### 3. Real-World Examples

**Popular projects using this approach:**

- **sqlite3 (npm):** Pre-built binaries for Node.js, 40M+ weekly downloads
- **Better-sqlite3:** Cross-platform SQLite extension with automatic binary selection
- **Python SQLite extensions:** Wheel distribution with platform-specific binaries
- **Rust crates:** Platform-specific compiled libraries via CI/CD

## Implementation Details

### Dependency Management

**Linux (Ubuntu):**
```yaml
- name: Setup build dependencies (Ubuntu)
  run: |
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libicu-dev
```

**macOS:**
```yaml
- name: Setup build dependencies (macOS)
  run: |
    brew install icu4c
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib/pkgconfig
```

**Windows:**
```yaml
- name: Setup build dependencies (Windows)
  run: |
    vcpkg install icu:x64-windows
```

### Build Matrix Configuration

**Comprehensive platform coverage:**
```yaml
matrix:
  include:
    # Latest and LTS versions for broad compatibility
    - os: ubuntu-20.04  # LTS, widely used in production
    - os: ubuntu-22.04  # Current LTS
    - os: macos-12      # Intel Macs
    - os: macos-14      # Apple Silicon
    - os: windows-2019  # Windows 10 compatibility
    - os: windows-2022  # Windows 11 compatibility
```

### Artifact Management

**Structured release assets:**
```bash
release-assets/
├── fts5icu-linux-x86_64.so
├── fts5icu-darwin-x86_64.dylib
├── fts5icu-darwin-arm64.dylib
├── fts5icu-win32-x86_64.dll
└── checksums.txt
```

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Traditional Manual Approach

**Developer Time:**
- Initial setup: 4-8 hours per platform
- Each release: 2-4 hours of manual builds
- Testing across platforms: 2-4 hours
- **Total per release: 8-16 hours of manual work**

**User Experience:**
- High barrier to entry (build tools required)
- Frequent build failures due to environment differences
- Extended time from source to usable binary

### Automated CI/CD Approach

**Developer Time:**
- Initial CI/CD setup: 4-8 hours (one-time)
- Each release: 5-10 minutes (automated)
- **Ongoing maintenance: ~1 hour per month**

**User Experience:**
- Instant download and usage
- No build environment required
- Consistent binaries across all platforms
- Verified with checksums

## Advanced Distribution Patterns

### 1. Package Manager Integration

**Future enhancement - automatic installation:**
```bash
# Homebrew (macOS)
brew install tkys/sqlite-extensions/icu-tokenizer

# APT repository (Ubuntu)
sudo apt install sqlite3-icu-tokenizer

# Chocolatey (Windows)
choco install sqlite-icu-tokenizer

# npm (Node.js projects)
npm install sqlite-icu-tokenizer
```

### 2. Semantic Versioning with Compatibility

**Version-specific binaries:**
```
v1.0.0 → Compatible with SQLite 3.35+
v1.1.0 → Compatible with SQLite 3.40+
v2.0.0 → Breaking changes, SQLite 3.45+ required
```

### 3. Dynamic Loading and Detection

**Smart binary selection (future):**
```python
import platform
import sqlite3

def load_icu_extension():
    system = platform.system().lower()
    arch = platform.machine()
    
    binary_map = {
        ('linux', 'x86_64'): 'fts5icu-linux-x86_64.so',
        ('darwin', 'x86_64'): 'fts5icu-darwin-x86_64.dylib',
        ('darwin', 'arm64'): 'fts5icu-darwin-arm64.dylib',
        ('windows', 'amd64'): 'fts5icu-win32-x86_64.dll',
    }
    
    binary = binary_map.get((system, arch))
    if binary:
        conn.load_extension(binary)
    else:
        raise RuntimeError(f"No binary available for {system}-{arch}")
```

## Quality Assurance

### Automated Testing

**Each binary is tested:**
```yaml
- name: Test binary loading
  run: |
    sqlite3 test.db ".load ./fts5icu-${{ matrix.platform }}.so"
    sqlite3 test.db "CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE test USING fts5(content, tokenize='icu');"
```

### Verification and Security

**Release integrity:**
- SHA256 checksums for all binaries
- GPG signing (future enhancement)
- Reproducible builds verification
- Automated vulnerability scanning
